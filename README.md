An open-source remake of a classic minigame from Nintendo Land. Supports online multiplayer for 2-5 players.

## Haunt a Spooky Mansion

Concealed by shadow, you will seek to outwit the ghost hunters and make them faint. A single touch is all it takes, but beware their searing lights! You must be clever if you are to catch the fiends off guard.

## Join Forces to Corner the Ghost

Each armed with a flashlight, you and your friends will delve into the darkness to hunt down the ghost. Even though you can't see the ghost in the dark, you can sense when it draws near. Stay together; you will not survive alone for long.
