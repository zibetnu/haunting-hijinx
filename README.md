An open-source remake of a classic minigame from Nintendo Land. Supports online multiplayer for 2-5 players.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Non-Steam multiplayer is currently unsupported.

## Haunt a Spooky Mansion

Concealed by shadow, you will seek to outwit the ghost hunters and make them faint. A single touch is all it takes, but beware their searing lights! You must be clever if you are to catch the fiends off guard.

- Your goal is to make all the hunters faint by grabbing them.
- You are invisible by default.
- Sprint to gain a helpful speed boost at the expense of being visible.
- Charge your summon meter to summon a drain area under each hunter. Any hunter that doesn't quickly get away will be defenseless as their battery gets drained.
- The hunters' flashlight beams will briefly stun you, make you visible, and deal significant damage.

## Join Forces to Corner the Ghost

Each armed with a flashlight, you and your friends will delve into the darkness to hunt down the ghost. Even though you can't see the ghost in the dark, you can sense when it draws near. Stay together; you will not survive alone for long.

- Your goal is to destroy the ghost by shining your flashlight on it.
- Your flashlight has limited battery life. You will need to pick up new batteries over time to keep the ghost at bay.
- You will be alerted when the ghost is nearby, though you should be wary of any tricks it may play to keep you on edge.
- Teamwork is essential. The ghost can easily outmaneuver a lone hunter but will struggle against a coordinated group.
- You will faint if the ghost touches you.
- Shine your flashlight on a downed hunter for a few moments to revive them. In the meantime, take care that you aren't vulnerable to being grabbed yourself!
